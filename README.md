Baby steps into Machine Learning

Following Google Developer Machine Learning Video series

1. Recipe for supervised learning (a technique to create a classifier from examples): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw

  1.1 Installed Anaconda for Python 2.7: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
  
  1.2 In repo type: `python hello-world.py`
  
  1.3 result: [1]
  
  Done. My first `hello world` in Machine Learning!

2. Visualizing a Decision Tree. Build one on a real dataset, add code to visualize it, and practice reading it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNa99PG8hR8

 2.1 create viz.py

 2.2 In repo type: `python viz.py`

 2.3 Pdf generation failed with this error: `GraphViz\'s executables not found'` Seems like a path problem with pydot

 2.4 Predictions work like a charm.
